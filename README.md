## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce11`:

   ```
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce11.git
   ```

1. **[ALL GROUP MEMBERS]**
   If you did not setup your Git username and email on Nike when working on `cs1302-ce07`,
   then please revist that exercise and follow the instructions presented there.

1. Change into the `cs1302-ce11` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
